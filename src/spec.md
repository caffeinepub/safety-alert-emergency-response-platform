# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build an emergency safety alert platform that connects citizens in distress with nearby police officers through real-time location sharing, dual authentication, and instant communication.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a landing page with safety-focused messaging and "Check Here for Safety" entry button
- Implement dual authentication system with separate sign-up/sign-in for "People" (citizens) and "Officer" (police) roles
- Build registration forms collecting name and mobile number for both user types
- Add location permission request with clear messaging when citizens initiate emergency alerts
- Capture and transmit citizen's live GPS location to nearest police station on help requests
- Create police officer dashboard displaying incoming help requests with citizen details (name, mobile, location)
- Implement real-time notification system alerting officers of new requests and citizens of accepted requests
- Add in-app calling functionality allowing officers to directly call citizens from request interface
- Build messaging system for quick text communication between citizens and responding officers
- Display status indicators showing request progression: Sent, Received, Accepted, Responding
- Apply professional emergency-focused design with safety colors, clear typography, and intuitive urgent-action layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Citizens can sign up, send emergency help requests with their live location to nearby police officers, and receive real-time status updates and messages. Police officers can view incoming requests on a dashboard, accept them, call citizens directly, send messages, and update response status.
